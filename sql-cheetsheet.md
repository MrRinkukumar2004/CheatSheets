# MS SQL Script Cheatsheet: Comprehensive Guide with Examples

## Database Operations

### Creating and Managing Databases
```

-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;

-- Use a specific database
USE CompanyDB;

-- Drop a database
DROP DATABASE CompanyDB;

-- Show all databases
SELECT name FROM sys.databases;

```


## Table Operations


### Creating Tables


```

-- Create a table with various data types
CREATE TABLE Employees (
EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
Department VARCHAR(50),
Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
HireDate DATE DEFAULT GETDATE(),
IsActive BIT DEFAULT 1
);

```


### Modifying Tables


```

-- Add a new column
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Phone VARCHAR(15);

-- Modify column data type
ALTER TABLE Employees ALTER COLUMN Phone VARCHAR(20);

-- Drop a column
ALTER TABLE Employees DROP COLUMN Phone;

-- Drop a table
DROP TABLE Employees;

```


## Data Manipulation


### Inserting Data


```

-- Insert single record
INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Email, Department, Salary)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@company.com', 'IT', 65000.00);

-- Insert multiple records
INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Email, Department, Salary)
VALUES
('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@company.com', 'HR', 55000.00),
('Bob', 'Johnson', 'bob.johnson@company.com', 'Finance', 60000.00),
('Alice', 'Williams', 'alice.williams@company.com', 'IT', 70000.00);

```


### Updating Data


```

-- Update specific records
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 68000.00
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;

-- Update multiple columns
UPDATE Employees
SET Department = 'Engineering', Salary = Salary \* 1.1
WHERE Department = 'IT';

-- Update with JOIN
UPDATE e
SET e.Salary = e.Salary \* 1.05
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.DepartmentName
WHERE d.Budget > 100000;

```


### Deleting Data


```

-- Delete specific records
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 5;

-- Delete with conditions
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Salary < 40000;

-- Delete all records (but keep table structure)
DELETE FROM Employees;

-- Truncate table (faster than DELETE)
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;

```


## Querying Data


### Basic SELECT Statements


```

-- Select all columns
SELECT \* FROM Employees;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary FROM Employees;

-- Select with alias
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName,
Salary AS AnnualSalary
FROM Employees;

-- Select distinct values
SELECT DISTINCT Department FROM Employees;

```


### Filtering with WHERE


```

-- Basic WHERE conditions
SELECT \* FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';

-- Multiple conditions with AND/OR
SELECT \* FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT' AND Salary > 60000;

SELECT \* FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR' OR Department = 'Finance';

-- Using NOT
SELECT \* FROM Employees WHERE NOT Department = 'IT';

-- Pattern matching with LIKE
SELECT _ FROM Employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';
SELECT _ FROM Employees WHERE Email LIKE '%@company.com';

-- Range filtering
SELECT \* FROM Employees WHERE Salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000;

-- List filtering
SELECT \* FROM Employees WHERE Department IN ('IT', 'HR', 'Finance');

-- NULL checking
SELECT _ FROM Employees WHERE Email IS NULL;
SELECT _ FROM Employees WHERE Email IS NOT NULL;

```


### Sorting and Limiting


```

-- Order by single column
SELECT \* FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary DESC;

-- Order by multiple columns
SELECT \* FROM Employees ORDER BY Department ASC, Salary DESC;

-- Limit results (SQL Server uses TOP)
SELECT TOP 5 \* FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary DESC;

-- Pagination with OFFSET and FETCH
SELECT \* FROM Employees
ORDER BY EmployeeID
OFFSET 10 ROWS
FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;

```


## Aggregate Functions and Grouping


### Common Aggregate Functions


```

-- Count records
SELECT COUNT(\*) AS TotalEmployees FROM Employees;
SELECT COUNT(Email) AS EmailCount FROM Employees; -- Excludes NULLs

-- Sum and average
SELECT SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalaries FROM Employees;
SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees;

-- Min and max
SELECT MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary, MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary FROM Employees;

-- Group by department
SELECT Department,
COUNT(\*) AS EmployeeCount,
AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary,
SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;

-- Having clause (filter groups)
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 60000;

```


## Joins


### Inner Join


```

-- Inner join
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName, d.Location
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.DepartmentName;

```


### Outer Joins


```

-- Left join
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.DepartmentName;

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.DepartmentName;

-- Full outer join
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.DepartmentName;

```


### Self Join


```

-- Self join (find employees and their managers)
SELECT e1.FirstName + ' ' + e1.LastName AS Employee,
e2.FirstName + ' ' + e2.LastName AS Manager
FROM Employees e1
LEFT JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;

```

WITH HighEarners AS (
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 65000
)
SELECT \* FROM HighEarners ORDER BY Salary DESC;

-- Recursive CTE (Organizational Hierarchy)
WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS (
-- Anchor: Top-level employees (no manager)
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, ManagerID, 0 AS Level
FROM Employees
WHERE ManagerID IS NULL

UNION ALL

-- Recursive: Employees with managers
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.ManagerID, eh.Level + 1
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID
    )

SELECT \* FROM EmployeeHierarchy ORDER BY Level, LastName;

```


## Indexes


```

-- Create clustered index
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Employee_ID ON Employees(EmployeeID);

DROP INDEX IX_Employee_Email ON Employees;

```


## Stored Procedures


```

-- Create stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDepartment
@Department VARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = @Department
ORDER BY LastName;
END;

-- Execute stored procedure
EXEC GetEmployeesByDepartment @Department = 'IT';

-- Stored procedure with output parameter
CREATE PROCEDURE GetDepartmentStats
@Department VARCHAR(50),
@EmployeeCount INT OUTPUT,
@AvgSalary DECIMAL(10,2) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
SELECT @EmployeeCount = COUNT(\*),
@AvgSalary = AVG(Salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = @Department;
END;

-- Execute with output parameters
DECLARE @Count INT, @Avg DECIMAL(10,2);
EXEC GetDepartmentStats 'IT', @Count OUTPUT, @Avg OUTPUT;
SELECT @Count AS EmployeeCount, @Avg AS AvgSalary;

```


## Transactions


```

-- Basic transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary \* 1.1 WHERE Department = 'IT';
INSERT INTO AuditLog (Action, TableName, Timestamp)
VALUES ('Salary Update', 'Employees', GETDATE());

-- Check if everything is OK, then commit
IF @@ERROR = 0
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
ELSE
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;

-- Transaction with try-catch
BEGIN TRY
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 999;
    UPDATE Departments SET Budget = Budget - 50000 WHERE DepartmentName = 'IT';

COMMIT TRANSACTION;
    PRINT 'Transaction completed successfully';
    END TRY

BEGIN CATCH
IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;

PRINT 'Error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    END CATCH;

```


## Performance Tips


1. **Use appropriate indexes** on frequently queried columns
2. **Avoid SELECT *** - specify only needed columns
3. **Use WHERE clauses** to filter data early
4. **Use EXISTS instead of IN** for subqueries when possible
5. **Avoid functions in WHERE clauses** on indexed columns
6. **Use UNION ALL instead of UNION** when duplicates don't matter
7. **Consider query execution plans** using `SET STATISTICS IO ON`


## Quick Reference


| Operation | Syntax |
|-----------|--------|
| Select All | `SELECT * FROM table` |
| Filter | `WHERE condition` |
| Sort | `ORDER BY column [ASC\|DESC]` |
| Group | `GROUP BY column` |
| Join | `JOIN table2 ON condition` |
| Insert | `INSERT INTO table VALUES (...)` |
| Update | `UPDATE table SET column = value WHERE condition` |
| Delete | `DELETE FROM table WHERE condition` |
| Create Table | `CREATE TABLE name (column datatype, ...)` |
| Drop Table | `DROP TABLE name` |

## 🏭 Stored Procedures

### 📋 Basic Procedure
```

-- 🔍 Get employees by department
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDepartment
@Department VARCHAR(50),
@MinSalary DECIMAL(10,2) = 0 -- Optional parameter with default
AS
BEGIN
SET NOCOUNT ON; -- 🚀 Performance optimization

    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Department = @Department
      AND Salary >= @MinSalary
    ORDER BY Salary DESC, LastName;
    END;

-- 🚀 Execute the procedure
EXEC GetEmployeesByDepartment @Department = 'IT', @MinSalary = 50000;

```

### 📊 Procedure with Output Parameters
```

-- 📈 Department statistics
CREATE PROCEDURE GetDepartmentStats
@Department VARCHAR(50),
@EmployeeCount INT OUTPUT,
@AvgSalary DECIMAL(10,2) OUTPUT,
@TotalBudget DECIMAL(12,2) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
SELECT @EmployeeCount = COUNT(\*),
@AvgSalary = AVG(Salary),
@TotalBudget = SUM(Salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = @Department;

    -- Return status: 0 = success, 1 = no data found
    IF @EmployeeCount = 0
        RETURN 1;
    ELSE
        RETURN 0;
    END;

-- 📊 Execute with outputs
DECLARE @Count INT, @Avg DECIMAL(10,2), @Total DECIMAL(12,2), @Status INT;
EXEC @Status = GetDepartmentStats 'IT', @Count OUTPUT, @Avg OUTPUT, @Total OUTPUT;

SELECT
@Status AS StatusCode,
@Count AS EmployeeCount,
@Avg AS AvgSalary,
@Total AS TotalBudget;

```

## 🔄 Transactions

### 🔒 Basic Transaction
```

-- 💰 Salary adjustment with audit
BEGIN TRANSACTION SalaryAdjustment;

BEGIN TRY
-- 📈 Apply 10% raise to IT department
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = Salary \* 1.1
WHERE Department = 'IT';

    -- 📋 Log the change
    INSERT INTO AuditLog (Action, TableName, RecordsAffected, Timestamp, UserName)
    VALUES ('Salary Increase', 'Employees', @@ROWCOUNT, GETDATE(), SYSTEM_USER);

    -- ✅ All good, make it permanent
    COMMIT TRANSACTION SalaryAdjustment;
    PRINT '✅ Transaction completed successfully - ' + CAST(@@ROWCOUNT AS VARCHAR(10)) + ' records updated';
    END TRY

BEGIN CATCH
-- ❌ Something went wrong, undo everything
IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION SalaryAdjustment;

    PRINT '❌ Transaction failed: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    PRINT '🔄 All changes have been rolled back';
    END CATCH;

```

### 🛡️ Transaction with Savepoints
```

BEGIN TRANSACTION MainTransaction;

-- 📍 Set savepoint
SAVE TRANSACTION SavePoint1;

UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary \* 1.05 WHERE Department = 'HR';

-- 🤔 If something specific goes wrong, rollback to savepoint
IF @@ERROR <> 0
BEGIN
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION SavePoint1;
PRINT '⚠️ Rolled back to savepoint, but transaction continues';
END

-- 📍 Another savepoint
SAVE TRANSACTION SavePoint2;

UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary \* 1.1 WHERE Department = 'IT';

-- ✅ Commit everything
COMMIT TRANSACTION MainTransaction;

```

## 🚀 Performance Tips

<div align="center">
<table>
<tr>
<td>🎯</td>
<td><strong>DO</strong></td>
<td>❌</td>
<td><strong>DON'T</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅</td>
<td>Use specific column names</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>SELECT *</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅</td>
<td>Create appropriate indexes</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>Over-index tables</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅</td>
<td>Use WHERE clauses early</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>Filter after SELECT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅</td>
<td>Use EXISTS for existence checks</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>Use IN with subqueries</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅</td>
<td>Use UNION ALL when possible</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>Use UNION unnecessarily</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

### 🔍 Query Analysis
```

-- 📊 Enable query statistics
SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;

-- Your query here
SELECT \* FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';

-- 📈 Check execution plan
SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON;

```

### 🎯 Optimization Examples

```

-- ❌ Slow - Function in WHERE clause
SELECT \* FROM Employees WHERE YEAR(HireDate) = 2023;

-- ✅ Fast - SARGable query
SELECT \* FROM Employees
WHERE HireDate >= '2023-01-01'
AND HireDate < '2024-01-01';

-- ❌ Slow - Leading wildcards
SELECT \* FROM Employees WHERE LastName LIKE '%son';

-- ✅ Fast - Leading characters
SELECT \* FROM Employees WHERE LastName LIKE 'John%';

```
